Product Development Cycle Management

Our team had a tight timeline (7 days) to design, develop, build and deploy this product. We needed a detailed plan to ensure an MVP would be completed by the submission due date. We also outlined a schedule for daily standups, communication channels to flag problems during development and a central repository where all documentation resided.
