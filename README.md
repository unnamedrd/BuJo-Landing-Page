Product Management

Our team had a tight timeline (7 days) to design, develop, build and deploy this product. We needed a detailed plan to ensure an MVP would be completed by the submission due date. We also outlined a schedule for daily standups, communication channels to flag problems during development and a central repository where all documentation resided.

## Define the problem, decide on a solution

BuJo Problem Statement: The bullet journal method was created by designer Rydell Carroll.Bullet Journals can be a fun, personal organization tool. The problem is they require maintenance and consistency. A lot of time, materials and especially skill goes into making even simple bullet journal layouts and that can be discouraging, especially for a beginner. 

So our team set out to create the BuJo application to turn the OG bullet journal method into a fun, digital experience. We wanted to make design accessible for non designers, giving them a place to practice their creative skills.  As an added bonus, making a more sustainable, less expensive alternative to the traditional method. 

We decided on building out the following features for an MVP. There were a few features that we marked as extra, to be tackled if time permitted. 

**MVP Features**

## Post Project Wrap Up

Learnings from Project: 
1.) We determined our tech stack early on, prior to deciding on a solution. In retrospect our tech stack should have been based on the solution that we were creating. In this case, the HTML Canvas API had some limitations when it came to some of the extra features we wanted to develop. If we had utilized React instead, implementing features like the typing tool for example could be achieved with a lot less code and in the timeframe that we had. 

2.) Allow ample time for testing and debugging. Our team was pretty confident about the timeline initially, but there was a fordimable bug both in the front-end development and backend development phase.
