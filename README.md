Product Development Cycle Management

Our team had a tight timeline (7 days) to design, develop, build and deploy this product. We needed a detailed plan to ensure an MVP would be completed by the submission due date. We also outlined a schedule for daily standups, communication channels to flag problems during development and a central repository where all documentation resided.

## First Step: Define the problem and settle on a solution:

BuJo Problem Statement: The bullet journal method was created by designer Rydell Carroll.Bullet Journals can be a fun, personal organization tool. The problem is they require maintenance and consistency. A lot of time, materials and especially skill goes into making even simple bullet journal layouts and that can be discouraging, especially for a beginner. 

So our team set out to create the BuJo application to turn the OG bullet journal method into a fun, digital experience. We wanted to make design accessible for non designers, giving them a place to practice their creative skills.  As an added bonus, making a more sustainable, less expensive alternative to the traditional method.
